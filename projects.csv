Had approached me about setting up a meeting to discuss streamlining their geospatial/attachment process for Traffic Counts. I said that mid August would be a good time for it because we were in the middle of the Sign Migration. 

### Processes to merge
1. **New Traffic feature layer** (that Frank Hereford worked on added TIAs volume counts) 
>He's given it to @jaime-mckeown to publish to AGOL and update the Traffic Count Web App
2. **Update traffic counts points in the Traffic Count Web App**
>We've merged the data sets into the new one on the first item. There were attachments that existed on those older features that we need to figure out what to do. Originally, the pdf files were being attached. We could update the process so that it points to the Data Tracker attached files that the team is updating now. 
3. **G drive network folder pulling Traffic Counts posting to Socrata Open Data Portal** (Status: Script is not  working)
>Requested to stop process, data sensitivity issue? _According to Jamie Atencio, this is what he told me_
4. **Traffic Count and Data Requests coming in to Data Tracker**

In this project, we are working on a process to aggregate trip origins and destinations in a way that does not risk re-identifying users, while still being of use to researchers, planners, and members of the public. 

<!-- Information below this line will not be pulled on to the website. DO NOT delete it. :) -->

After discussion with colleagues and industry experts, we have decided to remove the latitude and longitude data from our public dockless trips dataset. We’re doing this out of an abundance of caution. To be clear, no dockless user has been personally identified by the data we’ve released, and we believe that this risk is extremely low. 

There is no consensus from the community on how best to share this kind of location data, and it’s possible that the way we release dockless data will continue to change over time. Furthermore, we remain committed to being as transparent as possible with our dockless data management, and strongly believe that this data is a valuable community resource. 

We are also working to produce a dataset that provides aggregated trip origins and destinations in a way that does not risk re-identifying users, while still being of use to researchers and members of the public. More details on that soon.

Update: for folks that arrive here, we're using zenhub to group issues. Our workspace should be available to you [here](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/data--tech-services-5caf7dc6ecad11531cc418ef/board?epics=160746380_6&filterLogic=any&repos=140626918,153001229,160746380)

> Hi Stephen—apologies for the slow reply. My team has not had a chance to review the data that was collected. Would it be possible restore access to your app for a short time?
> 
> 
> To add some more info on related work we're doing for this project: there is currently an effort underway to digitize all of our street regulations in a geospatial database, using our Traffic Registry as the source. It's a major effort, including more than 50k regulations, which we expect to be complete early next year. We're using the city's planimetric data as a reference for curbline regulations, but there are also regulations that do not pertain to curbs, e.g., turning movement restrictions and stop signs.
> 
> 
> As part of this effort, we are also re-designing the process by which regulations are authored into the traffic registry, and migrating the registry itself, which is currently an Access DB, into our web-based workflow management system.
> 
> 
> Based on my limited understanding of your solution, my main point of concern is that the universe of regulations we need to track is larger than what your application supports, since we need to capture non-linear regulations such as stop signs. Further, once our digitization process is complete, we would need to migrate those records to your application and attach them to corresponding curbline features.
> 
> I can absolutely see value in having a user-friendly interface for maintaining our curbline feature data, but this may be redundant to other data management efforts in the city, particularly since we (ATD) do not manage curb and sidewalk infrastructure, that’s handled by the Public Works Department.

Publicly available web map that displays ATD's activities in the right of way. 

<!-- Information below this line will not be pulled on to the website. DO NOT delete it. :) -->
## Challenge
- Let the public know where we are (and have recently been) working in the right-of-way. 
- Meet the documentation requirements for obtaining a secondary (""blanket"") permit from ROW division to do signal work.

## Proposed solution
Public-facing map that shows dots and some very simple metadata for where we’ve been over the last 7 (?) days. The map could grab data from our current work order system, as well as data from employees that are not currently tracking their whereabouts (signal timing engineers, communications tech/engineer, construction inspectors). For these employees whose work is not currently tracked, we’d need some very simple form that they could mark their location and a brief description of work. This could be done on tablets or their phones. 

### Success measures
 - It helps us meet the reporting requirements for operating under a secondary permit
 - ROW division and 3-1-1 field fewer calls related to signal work in the ROW. 
 - High number of page views

## Users 
 - The public
 - ROW division staff
 - 3-1-1
 - TMC

## Stakeholders
We will identify AMD staff who will be stakeholders for the data collection piece of it. For the dashboard, we can get input from PIO and from ROW division.

> ATD had decided that they did not want to participate in the Maximo migration and did not want to offer funding towards the effort. DTS decided that since Transportation Engineers have been adding work orders for Signs and Markings into the Data Tracker since May 2018. The Markings work group migrated into the Knack environment at the same time and started entering their work tickets into the system leaving the paper process. The Street Banner Program uses Signs technicians for installation of banners and they too use MAXIMO. We indicated that Banners would migrate prior to Signs. Banners completed migration into Knack this April 2019. We are kicking off the Signs Migration to Knack project May 8th, 2019.

### As a manager I want to be able to track my permit staff's time more closely, so that I can better report on overtime needs and provide customers with a better idea of wait times. 

**Describe the outcome you'd like to see when this feature is implemented.**
Staff will be able to log their arrivals and departures.
I will be able to report more accurately on overtime worked. 
Perhaps we can tie this attendance tracking into our current (KNACK enabled) customer sign-in app, to inform a larger picture out our walk-in customer management. 

**Describe any workarounds you currently have in place or alternative solutions you've considered.**
Currently staff sends me an email when they arrive and leave. Its very difficult to answer questions about time worked using this solution. 

**What else should we know?**
We're considering using an existing CTM solution for this. 



**How would you rate the impact of this issue?**

## Feedback
### Successful outcomes
- Was easier for some people to submit online than fill out the PDF
- Digital submissions did not have to be transcribed. PDF submissions could be copy/pasted into PDF and Knack form submissions could be exported as PDF.

### Pain points
- (Amenity) Having to do multiple exports to an Excel file during the last day when 10+ new submissions came in
- (Linda) Having to email every division manager for confirmation on the last day 
- Excel online is buggy and slow, especially when multiple people are trying to edit/view at the same time

## Improvements
Operationally-speaking, the last-minute rush would be alleviated if we didn't schedule the meeting for the committee to review the nominations the day after nominations closed. 

There are also improvements to be made to the form itself. These might include: 
- ""Add another nominee"" button
     - We can collect first name, last name, and division for each nominee in a structured way
     - User interface is simplified — don't need to ask the ""individual or team"" question
- Automatic emails to relevant division managers to confirm approval so we do not have to scramble to follow up
- Automatic emails to committee members so they can review as nominations come in rather than at the last minute - or would this just be email clutter?
- Logins for committee members to review nominations (and maybe write notes?) directly in Knack instead of in Excel

464761648,320,Complie existing speed limit data,In Progress,ATSD,Data,No,"### Background #### 
The speed limit data was gathered by ATD GIS staff from the MUNI code a couple of years ago was added to the CTN about a year ago. Currently, 13% of all on-street segments of the CTN contain a speed limit from the MUNI code audit.

### Next steps ###

Some of the gaps may be easy to fill by look at NULL segments that are adjacent on both sides by segments with speed limit data. This is fairly common on several arterials.

Other easy to fill gaps exist in neighborhoods in which there are streets of the same level (usually 1 or 2) that have speed limit data and others that don't.

Manually filling in these gaps in the data in high priority areas ( streets on the high injury network, streets with near-future bike/ped improvements, neighborhoods surrounding schools) may be feasible while we wait on data purchases and other bulk solutions.

Tasks for Frank could include:

- [ ] QA speed limit data found in CTN to the MUNI code
- [ ] Fill in missing arterial speed limit data
- [ ] Fill in missing speed limit data in neighborhood streets.

We are building a platform to manage ATD’s complete portfolio of mobility-related infrastructure projects.  

<!-- Information below this line will not be pulled on to the website -->
#### How might we support comprehensive tracking of Austin’s mobility activities?  
The City of Austin Transportation Department has a diverse portfolio of mobility activities. These are currently tracked in various platforms — from simple spreadsheets administered by a single workgroup to bespoke enterprise software that tracks all capitally-funded projects. As a result, there is no centralized system of record, analysis and reporting capabilities are limited, and resources are not used efficiently. 

Using a single platform to track all of ATD’s mobility infrastructure projects would increase organizational alignment, enable holistic analysis and reporting, and lay the groundwork for robust business intelligence and data integrations.

- keys were not stored in 1Password

To do this we need to provide CTM ADFS team (currently John Dykowski) with our latest cert [see docs, here](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/wiki/Knack:-SSL-Certificate-Management). At the same time, we will need to install the certificate across all our Knack apps.

Here's the workflow I'm envisioning:
- Lewis does schedule online in Knack
- Randy references Knack schedule + shift number when creating schedules in Revolution 911
- Randy gives officers their shift number and link to Knack form in reminder email
On shift, officer follows link using iPhone, enters shift number, which auto-completes and links back to - a scheduled shift.
- This activates a “shift” record and redirects to shift “details” page
- the officer can repeatedly submit citation form from shift details
- Citation form automatically captures location
- When finished, officer hits “end shift” button to finalize

In Knack, this boils down to:

##### Objects
1. shifts < one to many relationship to citations
- shift_date
- shift_id
- assigned_to_badge_number
- status (scheduled, in progress, closed)
- planned_activities (types of enforcement to be conducted)
- locations (general area where shift is to take place)

2. citations (or, actions?)
- activity_type (citation, warning, no problems found)
- date
- location (captured automatically via location services)
- other stuff i'm forgetting

##### Pages
1. Schedule (object = shifts)
- Create, Edit, Search Schedule in calendar view

2. Shift Details (object = shifts + citations)
- start shift, add citation, edit citation, end shift

447796216,145,VZA Citation Reporting App,On Deck,AMD,New Application,Yes,"## Description
We are building an app for APD officers to use when making Vision Zero in Action citations. By digitizing the process, we can streamline workflows and collect structured data that we can use to inform VZA program management. 

<!-- Information below this line will not be pulled on to the website -->
### How might we measure the ROI of Vision Zero in Action's expenditures on APD VZA citation staffing?

### Challenge
[Vision Zero in Action](https://austintexas.gov/page/vision-zero-action) is a coordinated Vision Zero education and enforcement effort by Austin Transportation Department and Austin Police Department. Long term, data on APD's VZA citations would help the program improve enforcement scheduling and identify areas for targeted educational outreach. However the immediate need is being able to report on the efficacy of money spent on enforcement and maximize value.

### Request
A web app that APD can use to log Vision Zero in Action citation activities. Features would include

***Primary***
- Ability for APD officers to log time, location, and activity type of VZA citations
- Ability for ATD to see what shifts have been staffed and what citations were made during those shifts

***Secondary***
- Ability for ATD staff to query the information and identify geographic and temporal hotspots for different types of activities during certain time periods

### Target users
***APD***
- Scheduler 
- Officers on shift

***ATD***
- Vision Zero staff

### Stakeholders
- Jen Duthie, Division Manager, Arterial Management Division
- Lewis Leff, Transportation Safety Officer,  Vision Zero

### Additional information
***Previous applications***
Had a basic version in Knack, then made a new version with enhancements but died on the vine:
- [UI for scheduler to create shifts](https://atd.knack.com/amd#vision-zero-portal/)
- [UI for officer to log citations](https://atd.knack.com/amd#vision-zero-enforcment-officer-portal-login/vision-zero-enforcment-officer-portal/) — switch to the ""month"" view on the shift calendar and you will see a shift that you can click on
- [Data](http://transportation.austintexas.io/data-tracker/#vision-zero-portal/)

***Behaviors that targeted for enforcement***
- Safety enforcement
     - Failure to stop at red lights and stop signs (all vehicles, including bikes)
     - Speeding, including school zone speed compliance
     - Vehicles using bus-only lanes or parking in bike lanes
     - Driver inattention (i.e., enforcing the City’s Hands-Free Ordinance)
     - Failure to yield right of way (including at crosswalks or yield signs)
     - Lane splitting (i.e., riding a bicycle or motorcycle in between lanes)
     - Passing stopped school buses that are loading or unloading students
     - Failure to comply with pedestrian hybrid beacons
- Congestion management
     - Don’t Block the Box (enforcement for vehicles blocking cross-traffic by being present in an intersection when the light is red)
- Air quality
     - Enforcement for motor vehicles idling in the right of way (applies to heavy-duty vehicles weighing over 14,000 pounds)

- a Python smtpd mail server is created to receive new email messages
- the mail server calls a function to parse expected values from the email message
- the message contents are passed to knackpy, which creates a record in the selected application
It looks like smtpd is pretty simple (but I have not used it):

This also seems to be a popular 3rd-party Python mail server:

Arterial Management needs a warehouse management solution. They are responsible for tracking assets across multiple warehouse locations and vehicles. There are also an increasing number of non-AMD assets, such as bike racks, that are stored in the warehouse. 

<!-- Information below this line will not be pulled on to the website -->
The most pressing need is for a basic barcoding solution, however there are a range of [must-have user stories](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r2l_KFgjygCCp1E4oaBa5lyK2QzkVcP5qCu2u85UwcY/edit#gid=179231394) that extend into the realms of fully-featured inventory management and asset management applications. It is also critical that the software has solid API capabilities to ensure that we can build out integrations into finance and purchasing systems in the future. 

We initially looked into a warehouse inventory application offered as an add on to AIMS, but found it was [not a viable solution](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/64). As such, we'll be investigating both out-of-the-box vendor software along with the option of building in-house.

Subject: RE: Report: Weekly_Aging_Report_AMD
 
Doing some more digging, it looks like each of the four have the same “Activity” message on the CSR website:

 



 

They all list that “Review Interfaced Request” activities, and all appear to have been created/completed at the same date/time, that the Data Tracker shows as when the CSR was “closed”.  So I’m guessing that “interfaced” has to do with the Data Tracker system trying to contact and close the CSR on the CSR website? 

 

I guess it could be something for the CSR website people to also be brought in, and see where and how the failure of the CSR being closed, took place.

 

Thanks,

Jonathan

We have 18-00392934:

 



 

 

 

Then 18-00393326:

 

 



 

Then 18-00394421:

 



 

And finally 18-00394422:

 



 

 

I’m not sure why they all showed up on the aging report, when they’ve been closed for six weeks.  John/Diana, is this an issue with Data Tracker not sending the “closed” notifications to the CSR program? 

 

I did look on the old CSR Prod website, and it does show all four still open (Work In Progress) there:

 



 

 

I’ll go ahead and close them all through that CSR website, using the information that was entered in on Data Tracker.  But I wonder if there are any other CSRs that are showing closed on Data Tracker, but still actually open in the CSR program.

 

Thanks,

Jonathan

445550590,80,TCP Performance Measure Report Descrepancies,Icebox,ROW,Bug Report,No,"Description: Good evening John, Diana, and Tracy,


I have a question about the TCP Tracker reports in Knack. I want to know how many TCPs were submitted in a month and how many were reviewed. What is the best source?

 

Looking at the ‘Reviews per Project’, October lists 146 reviews.

 

Adding up all reviewers for October in ‘Reviews Completed’ totals 173.

 

‘Reviews Completed by Month’ for October displays 129.

 

‘Average Review Time By Month’, if summing up the numbers for October, has 221 reviews.

 

‘Intake Process by Month’ for October has a total of 142.

 

It seems like at least some of these should have the same number so I’m a bit hesitant to use any of them.

 

The performance measures I need to report each month are:

 

# of traffic control plans received
# of traffic control plans reviewed
% of TCPs reviewed within 9 business days (calculating from the Average Review Time By Month, comparing the 0-9 days field to the total of all columns)

[This page](http://transportation.austintexas.io/data-tracker/#home/school-flashers/school-zone-beacons/) does not have a filterable column to enable that type of reporting. 

Jen also noticed that at least one beacon, ""Travis Country"" is missing making us wonder if the data is up-to-date. And I noticed that many of these records have the same ""CREATED_DATE"" making me wonder if these have only been added as bulk imports. If so, then maybe there isn't a good column in this table to understand when a school beacon went online.

487123580,152,VZE: Add new columns to Crash Index table.,Backlog,VZ,Enhancement,No,"1. Add a column that is a concatenation of the different units
   - this would probably be a comma-separated list of all the related units. One complication is the description you get for motor vehicles vs ped/cyclist. We might need some if/else logic to have the most descriptive information if necessary. 
     - ex: `atd_txdot_units.body_style.veh_body_styl_desc` returns values like ""PICKUP"" and ""PASSENGER CAR, 4-DOOR""
     - `atd_txdot_units.unit_description.veh_unit_desc_desc` returns values like ""MOTOR VEHICLE"", ""PEDESTRIAN"", and ""PEDALCYCLIST""
   - John suggests: (how about icons for each type?)
